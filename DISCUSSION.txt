Tested taking it more than 10 letters and padding<br />
thefirsttenletters returns thefirsttenlettersxx<br />
Test Passed<br />

Tested the initialization of the motors according to the starting position<br />
Tested with 000<br />
Key offset returned correct number<br />

Tested the rotation of individual motors<br />
Each motor rotation adding 1 to the key offset for that specific rotor.<br />
Returned value passed<br />

Test permutations according to the order established.<br />
"YUMMYRAMEN" in permutation "3145926870"<br />
Expected "MUYRNMAEMY"<br />
Returned "MUYRNMAEMY"<br />
Test Passed<br />

Tested reversing the permutation for decryption<br />
"MUYRNMAEMY" is permutated according to the order "3145926870" back to "0123456789"<br />
Expected "YUMMYRAMEN"<br />
Returned "YUMMYRAMEN"<br />
Test Passed<br />

Tested encryption of "YUMMRAMEN" according to the discussion board with key<br />
configuration set at "000" and configuration of permutation set at "0123456789"<br />
Expected Value: "J3VK9D0TZT"<br />
Returned Value: "J3VK9VKHNL"<br />
ANALYSIS: Rotation of the middle rotor creates an issue with regard to the<br />
arithmetic for finding the corresponding <br />

Conclusion:<br />
Encryption Permutation functions<br />
Encryption works up to the 6 character<br />
Decryption Permutation functions<br />
Decryption not implemented <br />


Discussion<br />
The Enigma machine has a total complexity of 150,738,274,937,250. This is because of the 
three rotors having 17,576 possibilities. Each of the six wheels will therefore have a 
possibility of 6*17,576 = 105,456. And with the addition of the plugboard, the total 
complexity(number of possible states) increases to 150,738,274,937,250.
Our implementation of the enigma machine has three rotors each with 36 possibilities. 
Therefore there are 36*36*36 = 46,656 possible entries. The permutation consists of 10 
unique digits with a possible order of 10! which is 3,628,800. The initialization of the
rotors and the entries would then be 3!(36^3) = 279,936. The total possible entries would 
therefore be 1,015,831,800,000. This in comparison with the original Enigma machine is far
less complex. The bombe technique on this implementation would identify the most likely 
possible initial positions of the motor in relation to the permutation before a computer or
superComputer could be made to attempt the remaining possible combinations until a viable 
message was decrypted. The bombe technique would be easier on our implementation due to it
being 149 trillion less complex.
